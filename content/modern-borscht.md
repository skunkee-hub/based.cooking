- ‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: 30-45 min
- üç≥ Cook time: 90 min
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 8-10

## Ingredients

- 1 lb beef tenderloin, or stew meat if you are frugal
- 1 onion
- 3 carrots
- 2 large beets (or 3 medium beets)
- 4 celery shoots
- 2 large potatoes (Yukon Gold preferred, but any quality potatoes work)
- 3-4 cloves of garlic
- 4 cups of beef stock (or quality beef bullion such as "Better than Bullion" or equivalent and 4 cups water)
- 1/2 head of cabbage
- 1 heaping tbsp Cumin
- 1 heaping tbsp ground Coriander
- 1 can of diced tomatoes
- 3 bay leaves
- Olive Oil
- Butter
- Fresh (or dehydrated) dill
- Salt / Pepper
- Sour Cream (Optional)

## Dishes/Utensils Needed

- 3 large bowls
- 1 5 quart pot (5 litre pot) with a lid
- 1 strainer 

## Prep Directions (30-45 min)

1. Finely dice onion and garlic cloves. Set aside in large bowl 1.
2. Cut off beet greens. Skin carrots and beets. 
3. Finely slice carrots and celery (2-3 mm maximum, 1/16-1/8" maximum). Add to large bowl 1.
4. Shred beets using cheese grater. Or, if preferred, cut into small cubes no greater than 1x1 inch in size. Shredded beets break down better when cooked and release more flavor into the broth. Set aside in large bowl 2.
5. Cut beef into 1x1 inch cubes, or "Spoon size" cubes
6. *15 minutes before the end of the first simmer* - Cut potatoes into 1x1 cubes. Do not cut them too soon or the flesh will turn brown.
7. *After adding potatoes into the simmering mixture* - Remove outer leaf and cut head of cabbage into quarters. Then dice the quarters.

## Cooking Directions (90 min)

1. Use high heat and get the 5qt pot hot. Flick a few drops of water onto the pot and when they start "dancing" it is hot enough.
2. Coat the bottom of the pot with a thin layer of olive oil and let it heat up for about 30 seconds to 1 minute. 
3. Sear the beef on all sides until all cubes are browned. Salt and pepper the beef to taste. It is OK if the meat sticks to the bottom of the pot. Place a strainer in large bowl 3.
4. Once browned, remove the beef from the pot. Place into strainer and let the juices drain.
5. Add the carrot/onion/celery/garlic mixture from large bowl 1 to the hot pot. 
6. Add 1/4 to 1/3 stick of butter to this veggie mixture. Stir and agitate constantly until onions and celery are translucent and carrots begin to soften.
7. Add the strained meat, the beets from large bowl 2, the canned tomatoes, the beef stock, the cumin, the bay leaves, and the coriander to the pot. Stir until well blended.
8. Bring mixture to a boil on high heat. When a boil is achieved, reduce heat to a simmer and simmer for 60 minutes with the lid on. *REMINDER* - after 45 minutes, cube the potatoes. 
9. After 60 minutes of simmering, add the cubed potatoes and the dill (to taste) to the mixture. Stir until well blended. Cover, and simmer for 15 minutes. *REMINDER* - during this 15 minute simmer, dice the 1/2 head of cabbage.
10. After 15 minutes, or until potatoes are soft, add the cabbage to the pot. Simmer for 2 minutes uncovered to heat the cabbage. 
11. Serve. The cabbage should be hot, yet still crunchy. It will retain this crunchiness through refrigeration and re-heating due to the short heat cycle. 1-2 spoonfulls of sour cream is recommended per bowl for additional flavor.
